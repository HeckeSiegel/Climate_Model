# Climate Model
> This model grew organically over the course of 4 months as part of an Atmospheric Physics class.
It is a 1D model of the earth's atmosphere which calculates temperatures of the different atmospheric layers from the surface to the top of 
the atmosphere averaged over the whole globe.

## Physics
- Start with random temperature distribution over all layers
- Calculate change of temperature due to radiative transfer based on Schwarzschild's equation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild%27s_equation_for_radiative_transfer for each time step
