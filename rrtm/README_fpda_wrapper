Installation HOWTO and instructions on how to use them in your climate model code:

First, ignore all the shortwave routines(_sw) and try to understand the longwave(_lw) stuff.

change into the rrtm directory and try to compile it:
 cd rrtm && cmake . && make -j && make install

if that was successful you should find something like these files:
 ls ./install/lib/
             #~ libfpda_rrtm_lw.a  libfpda_rrtm_sw.a  libgnuplot_i.a

 ls ./install/bin/
             #~ rrtm_example_lw  rrtm_example_sw

there are actually two versions:
   # _FJ with 2D arrays implemented as 1D Fortran-style arrays, recommended by Fabian Jakub
   # _BM with 2D arrays implemented as 2D C-style arrays, recommended by Bernhard Mayer

History told us that students are indeed confused with the Fortran style arrays, so please, just ignore those and stick with _BM examples.

run the examples:
  ./install/bin/rrtm_example_lw_BM


have a look at the header files of the wrapper:
  vim ./install/include/fpda_rrtm_lw.h
  vim ./install/include/fpda_rrtm_sw.h

have a look at the example codes:
  vim ./src/fpda_example_lw_BM.c
  vim ./src/fpda_example_sw_BM.c


implement it into your model.
  cd <your_model_path>

when compiling, you need to add the include path to the header files:
  gcc -c mymodel.c -I./rrtm/install/include/

when linking your model you need to link against the rrtm libary and use the gfortran linker command to include fortran specific functions:
  gfortran -L./rrtm/install/lib/ mymodel.o -lm -lfpda_rrtm_lw -lfpda_rrtm_sw -lgnuplot_i

  # -L adds the following path to the linker includes i.e. tells the linker where to additionally look for libs
  # -l add librarys -- hence -lm adds the math library i.e. adds the libm.a
  # -lfpda_rrtm_lw adds the libfpda_rrtm_lw.a (those libraries we created above)


If any questions or problems arise please find me in my office.
